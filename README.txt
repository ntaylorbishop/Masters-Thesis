HOW TO USE:

	Use radio buttons to toggle view modes for Forward+ rendering
	Button is simply an example

KNOWN ISSUES:
	
	-Only fontColor is animatable at the moment. Needs a refactor.

DEEP LEARNING:

	This assignment has really shown me the power and detriment of using class templates. I tend to shy away from them, and have a knee-jerk reaction to not wanting to use things like inheritance and especially templates.
	Class templates in particular can be a pain, because someone down the chain has to say "These are the only allowed types" or else anything that the class template uses / anything using the class template will also hav to be
	templated. It can be a pain and almost goes to show that template programming is almost a different language than non-template programming in C++.
